## Content Formatting Tips

### Basic Structure
```html
<p class="article-lead">
    Your opening paragraph that hooks the reader.
</p>

<h2>First Section</h2>
<p>
    Your first section content...
</p>

<h2>Second Section</h2>
<p>
    Your second section content...
</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
    <li>First takeaway</li>
    <li>Second takeaway</li>
    <li>Third takeaway</li>
</ol>
```

### HTML Elements You Can Use
- `<p>` - Paragraphs
- `<h2>` - Section headings
- `<ul>` / `<ol>` - Bulleted or numbered lists
- `<li>` - List items
- `<strong>` - Bold text
- `<em>` - Italic text
- `<a href="...">` - Links
- `<code>` - Inline code
- `<blockquote>` - Quotes

## After Generation

The script creates:
1. **HTML file** in `articles/` folder
2. **Entry in writing-search.js** at the top of the array

Your article will automatically appear:
- On the homepage (if it's in the top 3 most recent)
- In the blog archive (writing.html)
- In search results

## Manual Editing

After generation, you can:
- Edit the HTML file to refine content
- Update meta tags if needed (though they're auto-generated correctly)
- Add images or other media
- Adjust formatting

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Script says "command not found"**
Make sure you have Node.js installed: `node --version`

**Q: Permission denied**
Run: `chmod +x create-article.js`

**Q: Article doesn't appear on homepage**
The homepage shows the 3 most recent articles. If you have more than 3, older ones won't show (but they're still in the blog archive).

**Q: Want to change the date format?**
The script uses ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD) which auto-format to "Month Year" on display.

ðŸŽ¯ **Consistent** - Every article follows the same structure

**Pro tip:** Keep your content pre-written in a separate document. When you're ready to publish, just run the script and paste!
