                <p>I've been a product manager for 8+ years, and I'll be honest—I was fortunate. I didn't have to hustle for coffee chats or build a portfolio from scratch to break in. But watching junior PMs struggle in today's market has made me realize something: we're all asking the wrong question.</p>

                <p>It's not 'How do I break into product?' anymore. It's 'How do I prove I can actually do this?'</p>

                <p>And the uncomfortable truth? Waiting for someone to give you that chance is just procrastination with better branding.</p>

                <p>The role of product manager is shape-shifting faster than I can wrap my head around. The job market is a dumpster fire. And yet if you've got a computer, twenty bucks, and a willingness to act <em>slightly</em> unhinged, there's never been a better time to just... start.</p>

                <h2>The new reality</h2>

                <p>Building a portfolio used to require a full team. You needed designers, engineers, analysts—people to help you move through discovery, building, testing, and iteration. Going solo meant hitting walls constantly or cutting corners that made your work feel incomplete.</p>

                <p>But we've hit an inflection point. With AI, you can actually move through the entire product lifecycle on your own. Need to validate an idea? It can help you think through the reasoning. Weak at data analysis? It'll walk you through it. Terrible writer? (Guilty.) It becomes your editor and your tireless collaborator who never gets tired of your questions.</p>

                <p>You can seek out problems, validate them, build solutions, and iterate—all without a team. Just you, your curiosity, and a slightly overeager AI assistant. So I started building things, just to see what I could do.</p>

                <h2>What I've been building (and what I've learned from failing)</h2>

                <p>Here's what that's looked like:</p>

                <p><strong>The wins:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Built a hero section POC in an hour that drove 24% of enrollments before we even built it natively. One hour of reasoning with AI about creator problems, desired functionality, and QA.</li>
                    <li>Reskinned an entire Teachable school while working on our new student home. Learned more about CSS structure and real-world customization nightmares than any documentation could teach me.</li>
                    <li>Created an embed code generator that sanitizes HTML for WYSIWYG fields. (Cybersecurity folks: I'm sorry. I know you're crying blood right now.)</li>
                    <li>Built this website. Intentionally no analytics because I refuse to let passion projects become profit projects.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The spectacular failure:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tried to build a certificate generator with HTML and Liquid. Gave up after two days. You can't win 'em all.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The part that matters most</h2>

                <p>Remember that question about proving you can do this? Here's what I learned: You prove it by playing. There is no joy in building without it.</p>

                <p>The grind doesn't stop just because you land the role. But maybe the grind isn't supposed to feel like grinding. Maybe it's supposed to feel like play. We can validate ideas, patch our weak spots, and practice critical thinking in real-time. Bad at writing? Terrible with data? Use AI as your training wheels while you learn to call out bad reasoning—yours and theirs.</p>

                <p><strong>So here's my challenge to you:</strong> Stop waiting for the perfect team, the perfect role, or the perfect moment. Take your $20, open your laptop, and build something weird this weekend. Build something bad. Build something that makes you laugh.</p>

                <p>Because there's no day like today. And if not now, then honestly—when?</p>

                <hr>

                <p><strong>Before you come at me about AI:</strong> Yes, it hallucinates. Yes, it uses too much water. Yes, it yammers on about useless things.</p>

                <p>It's basically mimicking what life is like in corporate anyway. We all know a dude who's on a carnivore diet, drinks too much, and thinks way too highly of themselves. At least with AI, I can call it out without getting the stink eye or a passive-aggressive Slack message later.</p>
