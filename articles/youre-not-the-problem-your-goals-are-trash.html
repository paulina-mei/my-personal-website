                <h2>Every January, my feeds fill up with 'new year, new me' posts, and every January I'm reminded that most of us are recycling the same terrible goals and expecting different results</h2>

                <p>Every year, the same thing happens.</p>

                <p>The calendar flips, the internet dusts off its "fresh start" content, and suddenly everyone has a new morning routine, a new reading goal, a new gym plan. And yet, by February, most of us are quietly back to… vibes.</p>

                <p>It is not because we are lazy. It is because our goals are, frankly, terrible.</p>

                <p>They're vague enough to mean nothing, rigid enough to be impossible, and unmotivating enough that even when we <em>do</em> make progress, it doesn't feel like anything worth celebrating.</p>

                <p>Let's talk about that.</p>

                <h2>Your goals kind of suck (and yes, I've had the same ones)</h2>

                <p>If I asked you what your personal goals have been over the past few years, I'm willing to bet they'd sound familiar:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Be rich"</li>
                    <li>"Be fit"</li>
                    <li>"Eat better"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I've written versions of those down myself, usually in some new notebook I was convinced would fix my life.</p>

                <p>The problem is not that these are bad desires. The problem is that they're empty containers. "Rich" in what? Cash? Time? Love? Validation? "Fit" for what? Running a half marathon? Keeping up with your kids? Being able to walk up a hill without mentally writing your will?</p>

                <p>When a goal is that fuzzy, your brain has nothing to aim at. You cannot tell if you're closer or farther away. There is no satisfying "I did it," just a never-ending sense of "not there yet."</p>

                <p>So instead of "be rich," you end up with something more honest like:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Have six months of expenses saved so I can quit if work turns into a dumpster fire."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Or instead of "be fit":</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Be able to take a 45-minute hike without needing two business days to recover."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Suddenly there's a picture. A feeling. A finish line.</p>

                <p>SMART goals exist for a reason, but I think they left out the part that matters most: how it <em>feels</em>.</p>

                <p>Try asking yourself:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>How do I feel when I think about this goal right now?</li>
                    <li>How would I feel if I actually hit it?</li>
                    <li>How would I feel if I never did?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If there's no emotional charge in those answers—no relief, no pride, no "oh my god, that would be nice"—it might not be a goal worth keeping. Or at least not in that form.</p>

                <h2>The way you measure your goals is doing you dirty</h2>

                <p>Even when the goal is clear, the measurement is usually where things go sideways.</p>

                <p>Take the classic: "Work out 4 times a week."</p>

                <p>On paper, it's clean. In life, not so much.</p>

                <p>Does walking count?<br>
                Does yoga count?<br>
                What if you went for a 25-minute walk but never broke a sweat—was that nothing?<br>
                If you only make it three days one week, was the whole thing a failure?</p>

                <p>We do this to ourselves constantly: build these brittle little systems, then act surprised when they shatter the first time real life happens.</p>

                <p>If you peel it back, the real outcome is usually something softer and more human, like:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"I want to move my body more so I don't feel like a piece of forgotten furniture."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Cool. That's actually workable.</p>

                <p>From there, "movement" can be stretchy. A walk, a dance break in your kitchen, a slow yoga video you mostly do lying down, a workout class where you spend half the time confused in the back row—all of that still counts toward the thing you actually care about.</p>

                <p>Think of it like an early-stage product: version 1 is not the final, polished release. It's the scrappy prototype that proves there's something here. You can tighten the definition later. For now, the only real goal is: <strong>make it possible to win.</strong></p>

                <h2>Your goals are unmotivating (and that's fixable)</h2>

                <p>Even if your goals are clear and flexible, there's another problem: a lot of them are just… dull.</p>

                <p>"Be healthier."<br>
                "Save more money."<br>
                "Network consistently."</p>

                <p>Technically admirable. Emotionally, kind of a beige wall.</p>

                <p>We spend all this time building discipline systems and almost no time making the experience even slightly delightful. No wonder it feels like a slog.</p>

                <p>This is where I'm a big fan of straight-up bribery.</p>

                <p>Not the "I earned my coffee for going to the gym" discourse. I mean real, specific treats. Things you daydream about but rarely let yourself have:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A massage</li>
                    <li>That one absurd dessert you always talk yourself out of</li>
                    <li>A new gadget or toy you absolutely do not "need"</li>
                    <li>A guilt-free takeout night where you refuse to open your laptop</li>
                    <li>An afternoon alone with a book and your phone on airplane mode</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Now we tie them together.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"If I complete 12 intentional movement days this month, I'm booking a massage."</li>
                    <li>"If I hit my savings target for two months, I'm buying the thing I keep adding to cart and abandoning."</li>
                    <li>"If I stick with my food plan 80% of the time for three weeks, I'm getting that ridiculous slice of cake and enjoying every bite."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Is this revolutionary? No. Does it work better than "I'll feel proud, theoretically, at some undefined point in the future"? Absolutely.</p>

                <p>There is no award ceremony at the end of the year where someone hands you a plaque for "internalized growth." Sometimes you just need the cake.</p>

                <h2>Treat yourself like your favorite 0–1 project</h2>

                <p>If you've spent years falling short of your goals, it doesn't mean you're broken. It usually means the system was bad.</p>

                <p>Vague.<br>
                Rigid.<br>
                Boring.</p>

                <p>So instead of "new year, new me," try something smaller and more honest:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Pick one old, vague goal and rewrite it so a stranger would know what it means and why it matters.</li>
                    <li>Make the first version easy enough that you can't help but rack up some wins.</li>
                    <li>Attach a little treat to the first meaningful milestone, and actually follow through.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>You already know how to do this at work. You scope projects, you iterate, you tweak success metrics when the first draft doesn't make sense.</p>

                <p>You're allowed to do that with your own life, too.</p>

                <p>You're not an OKR. You're not a performance review. You're the person who has to live with the outcomes.</p>

                <p>Might as well make the process a little fun.</p>
