                <p>I used to be internet famous, and now I help internet-famous people stay authentic and actually deliver value to their audiences—which might be the perfect ending to that story.</p>

                <p>One way to measure growth is to be uncomfortable. I've been forcing myself to get out of my comfort zone this past year: going to more events, trying new hobbies, doing more things by myself, and most importantly, writing more. (Sure, it's AI-assisted, but I promise I always write the first draft myself!) And thus, I decided a website was probably required. (I'll write another post on how I used Claude Code to generate this, but hi—new home for my writing!)</p>

                <p>I was an early user of Tumblr back in the day and used to blog about music and my hopes and dreams for the future—what I would be when I "grew up," what life would be like as I transitioned from my small hometown in Vermont to... somewhere else, anywhere else, and whether I'd make it.</p>

                <p>It's also where I gained quite a bit of fame as a creator. I ran a Pokémon meme blog that actually generated a fair amount of revenue. Our growth was really fast, and it was all organic back in the day. We partnered with artists to do giveaways and sell merch. It was a lot of fun, but as a teenager, I didn't think a career on the internet would be fruitful. Prior to that, I used to stream with friends and would have thousands of people watching us. It was really weird to have random people come up to me who recognized me from the internet.</p>

                <p>I sometimes ruminate on what life could have been like if I had continued. Would I still have had to get a 9-5? Would it still be fun when it becomes your livelihood?</p>

                <p>Perhaps I am old and boring now, but I like being a bit mysterious. As the kids say, I have lore.</p>

                <p>I get a lot of pleasure being on the other end of the business now—figuring out how to ensure that people don't burn out and can remain authentic as themselves on the internet while helping their audiences actually achieve their learning outcomes. I get a steady paycheck while still fueling one of my passions. It's also started to open up these creative doors I've kept shut for a long time, helping me understand how you can apply lessons from the past to remain relevant and well-loved amongst your audience today.</p>

                <p><strong>Maybe the best way to stay on the internet isn't to be the star—it's to help others shine while keeping a little mystery for yourself.</strong></p>
